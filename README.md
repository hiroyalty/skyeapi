The Implementation of MTN Top Up solutions

A Solution that based off the PHP Slim framework, I implement the MTN's (Nigeria's 
Foremost Telecommunications firm) Top Up Credit system, which can I be called over HTTP to credit users.

There is back-end reporting system developed on Oracle Application Express.

test.php was a sample USSD script that can be deployed on any shortcode over http
to allows users to credit themselves by dailing into the shortcode.
